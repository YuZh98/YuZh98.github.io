I am currently a Ph.D. student in Statistics at University of Florida (UF), advised by Dr. [Leo L. Duan](https://leoduan.github.io/).

My research interests mainly lie in Bayesian statistics and MCMC. More specifically, I focus on sparse modeling and high-dimensional clustering. My recent research focuses on (i) posterior consistency of clustering under the forest model and (ii) a problem of combinatorics and graph theory (spanning trees).
