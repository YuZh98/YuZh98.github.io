I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at University of Florida (UF), advised by Dr. [Leo L. Duan](https://leoduan.github.io/).

My research interests mainly lie in Bayesian modeling and machine learning methods. I have proposed innovative models and algorithms for problems such as high-dimensional clustering, variable selection, and image smoothing. On top of that, I am also interested in the asymptotic behavior of estimators and MCMC algorithms.
