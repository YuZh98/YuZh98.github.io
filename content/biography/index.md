I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at University of Florida (UF), advised by Dr. [Leo L. Duan](https://leoduan.github.io/).

My research interests center around Bayesian statistics and optimization, with a focus on high-dimensional clustering and combinatorial problems. I am particularly skilled in theoretical analysis, including convergence rate control and asymptotic distribution analysis. In addition to my analytical work, I enjoy programming in R, Python, and occasionally C++. With over five years of experience, I have developed machine learning and deep learning projects across a variety of applications.
