I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the University of Florida (UF), advised by Dr. [Leo L. Duan](https://leoduan.github.io/).

My research interests center around Bayesian statistics and optimization, with a focus on high-dimensional clustering and scalable MCMC algorithms. I am particularly skilled in theoretical analysis, including convergence rate control and asymptotic distribution analysis. In addition to my analytical work, I enjoy programming in R, Python, and C++. With over five years of experience, I have developed machine learning projects across a variety of applications.

I am passionate about machine learning, statistical modeling, and quantitative research, with a strong belief in the power of data-driven decision-making. Over the last decade, AI has transformed every aspect of our lives, and financial markets are no exception: trading is rapidly shifting from human intuition to systematic, model-driven strategies powered by vast streams of information that no human could process alone.

I embrace this transformation. To me, quantitative research is about building efficient models that harness data, balance risk and reward, and adapt to fast-moving markets. With a background in mathematics and statistics and research experience in scalable Bayesian methods and deep learning architecture, I am prepared to contribute to innovative strategies in a fast-paced, data-driven environment, and **I welcome opportunities to connect about roles in quantitative research and machine learning**.
